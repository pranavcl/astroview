# üåå Astroview

This project is a submission for the [**NASA 2025 Space Apps Challenge**](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/). Made by team **ImageInators**.

‚ú® **ASTROVIEW** is a hub for **anyone** to explore and view splendid images of Space, Earth and Planets captured by satellites from [NASA](https://nasa.gov) and other Space Agencies. It can view images in **full resolution**, **zoom and pan** to **discover new patterns** and features, **annotate with pens and shapes of various thicknesses and colors** with just a click. A simple and intuitive experience to experience the marvelous universe we live in, simply from¬†our¬†browser. üåê

üñºÔ∏èOur project takes **high resolution images** from datasets by **NASA** or other Space Agencies, which is converted to a DeepZoom([.dzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom)) file format which contains thousands of smaller images, so that it can be viewed smoothly in lower-end devices and even embedded in browsers. Then, we annotate on top of the image using [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/), a library of JavaScript used for simulation and creative coding. We host all these features on a web app made with **JavaScript, CSS and HTML**. We also used tools like [**Figma**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma) and [**Freeform**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeform/id6443742539) to design and plan the features for¬†our¬†project.

## How to run

1. First, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranavcl/astroview
```

2. Start a web server in the root of the cloned directory using something like Python:
```bash
cd astroview
python -m http.server 3000
```
3. Open your web browser at the port (https://localhost:3000)

4. To add new images, you must download [vips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) first. Add the .jpeg image to the `./dzi_images` directory and convert it to the DZI file format using the following command:

```bash
vips dzsave jpeg_image_name.jpg dzi_image
```

5. Open the new image in the viewer by going to `https://localhost:3000?img=dzi_image`
